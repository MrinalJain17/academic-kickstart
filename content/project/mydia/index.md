- Developed an efficient and user-friendly python library for reading videos as NumPy tensors with more than 50,000* cumulative downloads (according to the tracker [PePy](https://pepy.tech/project/mydia)).
- Utilized pythonâ€™s multiprocessing capabilities to read (multiple) videos in parallel, thereby reducing video processing time by 4x compared to other similar tools.
- Implemented other features, including custom frame selection in videos, frame resizing, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization.
