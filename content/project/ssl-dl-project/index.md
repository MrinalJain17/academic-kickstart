- Pre-trained a denoising auto-encoder to be used as a feature extractor for road map construction, using images captured from moving vehicles.
- Combined the feature embeddings of the multi-view scene from each vehicle and used a U-Net to generate a top-down view of the binary road map.
- Achieved a threat score of 0.70 on the hold-out test set as part of the intra-class competition (with the best score in the class being ~0.81).
