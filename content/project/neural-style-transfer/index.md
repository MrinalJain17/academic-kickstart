- Reimplemented the seminal work by Gatys et al. titled "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (using PyTorch).
- Programmed numerous extensions to [preserve color](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05897) and improve the [algorithmâ€™s quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603) (primarily based on the gram matrix characteristics).
- Implemented the fast style transfer method proposed by Johnson et al. working in real-time (~ seconds) compared to the original optimization-based algorithm (~ minutes).
