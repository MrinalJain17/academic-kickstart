*This was the capstone project of the Machine Learning Nanodegree*

Used a 3-dimensional CNN to identify the basic human actions like running, jogging, walking, clapping, hand-waving and boxing.

Tested different model architectures and tuned various hyper-parameters, and achieved an overall accuracy of **~65%** on the test dataset.
